<h1>Benchmark Test Suite</h1>
The creation of a Benchmark Versioning Control system for our Embedded Tablets using simple modular tests that are capable of running independently and without supervision. These tests are then bundled together to create a device object with the tablet's specifications and store it into a database for quick lookup and device comparison.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>For the Test Host</h3> 

[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (or a similar Shell Command Language) which should come pre-installed on macOS and most Linux systems. [ADB](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/) and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) which both can be installed with the links provided. 

<h3>For the Server</h3>
